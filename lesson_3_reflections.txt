When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I want an online backup of a project and/or when I want to collaborate on a project with a colleague. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So I can choose when to push/pull changes that are ready to share. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Clone: used to make a copy of a repository (remote to local or local to local). 
	Branch: used to make parallel development of new features that could later be incorporated into the master. 
	Fork: a feature of GitHub used to make copies of remote repositories. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	So you are sure to be working on updated code and your commits will be easy to merge to remote.

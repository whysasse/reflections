When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I want an online backup of a project and/or when I want to collaborate on a project with a colleague. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So I can choose when to push/pull changes that are ready to share.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	We initialize a repository to instruct git to create its .git directory and begin keeping track of files. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It allows the developer to choose which files are going to be part of a specific commit.
